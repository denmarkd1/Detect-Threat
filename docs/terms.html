        <h2>Service Description</h2>
        <p>
          DT Scanner is a defensive mobile watchdog tool that runs local checks and highlights suspicious
          configuration or permission changes.
        </p>

        <h2>No Absolute Security Guarantee</h2>
        <p>
          DT Scanner helps improve security awareness but cannot guarantee complete detection of every threat,
          attack, or compromise scenario.
        </p>

        <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You are responsible for acting on scan results and maintaining device hygiene.</li>
          <li>You should review app permissions and system settings before making security decisions.</li>
          <li>You should maintain device backups and update your OS regularly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Trial and Subscription</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>DT Guardian provides a 7-day free trial for first-time users.</li>
          <li>After trial, users may remain on a limited free tier or choose an opt-in weekly, monthly, or yearly subscription.</li>
          <li>Yearly plan grants 12 months of service for the price of 10 months.</li>
          <li>Subscription amounts are region-based and may differ by country and currency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Billing Channels</h2>
        <p>
          Digital subscriptions are processed through official app store billing channels where required by
          platform policy. Optional external donations do not unlock or replace paid subscription access. Free-tier
          feature limits are enforced locally in-app until official store entitlements are active.
        </p>

        <h2>Support Hotline and Ticket Queue</h2>
        <p>
          DT Guardian provides an AI-assisted web support hotline and ticket workflow for feature requests
